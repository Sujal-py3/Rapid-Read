**Book Summarizer**

Overview

The Book Summarizer is an NLP-based application that generates chapter-wise summaries of books. If a book does not contain distinct chapters, the entire book is summarized as a whole. This tool is designed to provide concise and meaningful summaries while preserving the key ideas and intent of the original text.

Why Summarize a Book?

Summarizing a book helps condense information while maintaining the original meaning.

It enables quicker comprehension of complex ideas and concepts.

A summary captures the authorâ€™s main points, purpose, and supporting details in a structured manner.

How It Works

The summarizer is built using the T5-small pretrained model from Hugging Face Transformers.

Summary Generation Process:

The book is divided into chapters.

Each chapter is further split into smaller chunks for processing.

The T5Tokenizer is used to tokenize the text.

The tokenized text is fed into the T5ForConditionalGeneration model to generate summary tokens.

The summary tokens are decoded into readable text using the decode() function from T5Tokenizer.
